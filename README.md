This project conatains two branches a **master** branch and a **remoteApi** branch:
- **master branch**: contains all the functionalities except remote api call
- **remote api**: contains everything but I couldn't get the app to fetch the list of rooms from the remote api and I don't know why. And because implementing the remote api call requires modifying existing files and potentially spoiling my existing work, I decided to include it in my master branch
